# Native-Language-Translator
This repository will be used for all code related to the Translator project. For the time being it will be Naskapi, Innu to English

ON HOLD, not enough knowledge/experience to deal with the data I need to use. I will be going through the fast.ai course to see if I can learn anything applicable to this project.

List of current goals:
  - Compile list of needed python libraries
  - General research about Naskapi/Innu language
  - Find/Create datasets of Naskapi/Innu syllabics
    - This includes every "letter" and the Roman alphabetical version of it for machine learning.
    - Converter for Naskapi/Innu syllabics to the Roman alphabet ( a,b,c etc.)

Future goals:
  - Find PDF or text file version of Lexicon/Dictionary/Any computer file containing words and definitions for Naskapi/Innu
  - Eventually find scanned documents of handwritten Naskapi/Innu that can be used for ML purposes
  - After being able to convert to Roman alphabet match "translated" words/phrases to an entry in a dictionary
